# Raffle
Created a raffle application for final project at Santa Clara University for COEN161 class. 

Application saves input data to MongoDB and retreives it from MongoDB in order to determine the winner.

You enter your name and amount of tickets you want to buy on the homepage and then you click continue to the second page to check if you won or someone else did.
